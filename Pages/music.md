  I make music with the ocarina. Yes, it's a real instrument, and it has more history than the Legend of Zelda games. In 1853, Giuseppe Donati invented the transverse ocarina in Italy, and variations on the instrument have been created since. I picked up a plastic 12-hole ocarina during a moment of weakness at Comic Con 2018, and got to practicing consistently enough that I got my first ceramic ocarina. From there, the collection grew.

  In 2021, Value 4 Value music came on the scene repurposing tech made to keep podcasts decentralized and censor-proof. It was applied to music starting with an <a href="https://podcastindex.org/podcast/4630863"> album published by Able and the Wolf</a>. I've never been interested in playing the game of centralized platforms, so in 2024 I decided to publish my music V4V and support other artists the same way.
