Hi, I'm Matt. 

![Me on vacation](/upload/headroom/2024/09/height-thailand.jpeg)

Yes, I'm very tall. Five feet and twenty two inches, to be precise. 

To answer some other common questions:
- No, I don't play basketball
- My shoe size 15
- The weather is perfectly fine up here, but I do have a fun answer when asked outdoors

Professionally, I write words in a way that computers execute them. I'm a software engineer. I've also attained my CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certificate, so you could say I've an avid interest in InfoSec. I've worked with a number of technologies, including notable mentions such as:
- C# and .NET/.NET Core
- Scala
- SQL Server
- Assorted component based frontend frameworks including LitElement, Polymer, React, and Angular
- CSS/LESS/Sass

If you want to talk to me about a potential opportunity or anything else, [send me an email](mailto:hello@mattthetall.site).

By a friend's definition, in 2023 I became professional musician when offered money for my ocarina playing without soliciting it. Since then, I've recorded some music that I publish [Value 4 Value](https://value4value.info/), and you can find links for the music [here](/music). 

For some other places on the vast Net where you can find me, take a look at the [link tree](/link-tree).

I've dabbled in a wide range of interests such as combat arts, ballroom dance, Renaissance reenactment and nerd conventions, so you'll likely find many a disparate subject covered here as I write more.
