Title: Autumn Rust Boost Recap Feed is Live

permalink: autumn-rust-boost-recap

After the Satellite Skirmish: Autumn Rust concluded, boo-bury organized a session to record a reading of all the boosts that came in during the show and up to the recap. If you didn't catch the Skirmish, you can watch the recording [here](https://podverse.fm/episode/hjLnLgm9Q) or find it in a [new podcast app](https://podcastindex.org/apps?appTypes=app).

Thanks to the RSS feed for the show, people can send value even after the festivities are over, so there were some reads of boosts that came in between Autumn Rust and the recap. It was fun hanging out with boo-bury, Frankiepaint, SirSpencer, and Em of Survival Guide reading through the boosts to credit and thank everyone who sent them. Much like the Skirmish, you can listen to the recap in your choice of new podcast app or [follow this link](https://podverse.fm/episode/vqujk5ETV).
