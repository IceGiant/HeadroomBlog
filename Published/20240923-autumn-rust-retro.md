The Skirmish is over, and it was a great time. Something went wrong with the stream during the first song of the set, so there was a sound loop that threw things off. If it was the restreaming system, sounds like it should get fixed in the recording when that's all put together (edit: not an issue in the recording). Despite that causing a temporary halt to my set, I played through the rest of it afterward and managed to squeeze in finishing before the time was up with something like 15sec spare. 

Lessons learned:
- Record locally while streaming, just in case
- Get a condenser mic and an arm for it (probably AT2020, but open to recommendations)
  - Should pick up less of the room than the dynamic I have right now
  - Easier to get close so my voice is audible
  - One caveat will be to figure out a shortcuts/macros to switch between audio profiles for ocarina and voice
- Use a relaxant, perhaps? I was chock full of adrenaline during that performance, particularly after the stream issues with the first song, so a shot of liquor shortly before the set might have taken the edge off. 

It was a ton of fun going through the live chat after the set to both respond to people and see the discussion about my sword when people noticed it in the background. ðŸ˜†

Thank you to the production crew and everyone else who made the event happen. Would love to perform in future Skirmishes and more events.
