Title: Hello World!
permalink: hello-world

For anyone who works remotely close to software, the title choice for this post probably comes as zero surprise. For quite a long time, I've played with the idea of setting up a blog, and getting the domain name on the cheap for the first year helped me pull the trigger for actually making one. 

This blog was set up using [MyWebLog](https://bitbadger.solutions/open-source/myweblog/) made by Daniel J. Summers. When I asked about recommendations for blogging systems, I went with his system both because of the common touchstone of [No Agenda](https://www.noagendashow.net/) , a comedic show full of news deconstruction and analysis, and it's always nice to be able to directly ask questions to the person who wrote software you're using.

An added reason for the choice is there's support for Podcasting 2.0 features. If that's a new term for you, you can read more about it at the [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/). I don't know whether I'll go about starting my own show, but I do want to take advantage of those features for my music.

Yes, music. One of the cool things that's spun out of Podcasting 2.0 and its enabling of [V4V](https://value4value.info/) (Value 4 Value) podcasts, and that tech is also being used for music in the same vein. Another of desire for this site is  it will be where I self host my feeds for V4V music. I play a somewhat esoteric instrument that most people either haven't heard of or think only exists in the Legend of Zelda games: the ocarina.

Perhaps the story of how I got into the instrument and learned how to play should be a next post. ðŸ¤”
