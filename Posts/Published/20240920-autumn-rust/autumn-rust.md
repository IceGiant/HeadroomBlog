The show will be kicking off at 2pm Pacific Sunday. The Skirmish is an online Value 4 Value battle of the bands format where the artist who receives the most donations in satoshis (a small fraction of a bitcoin) wins the competition. 

You can watch the show [here](https://liveislit.com/), and if you want to send boosts (pieces of bitcoin with a message) live during the show to support me, I'd recommend downloading Podcast Guru and setting up a wallet that connects to the app. 

I'll be unveiling three songs I'm working on that have yet to be recorded. Anyone who wants a say in which one gets published first can send boosts during the show, and the song that gets the most sats will get recorded before the others.
